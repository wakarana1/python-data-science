# what is data science?

## intersection of CS, math and stats, domain knowledge and how to communicate the data.

data science process:
- business goals
- data gathering
- data prep
- model
- evaluation
- implementaiton

# PANDA
Pandas is a py library that makes py similar to R
  helps you read strutctured data
  primary objects are DataFrames


```python
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
df = pd.read_csv('kc_house_data.csv')
```

# Types of variables for DS
categorical variable
  df['zipcode'].nunique() # number of unique, similar to sql distinct
  df['zipcode'].unique() # gives unique values
  df['zipcode'].value_counts() # similar to sql grou_by

numeric varaible
  mean - avg
  median - middle
  mode - most frequent

df.describe() # shows descriptive stats

Data scientists read data, sees if data is good or bad or has outliers
as a DS, you cannot assume, you have to verify

prepping, or getting data, cleaning data, preparing data, is 70% of Data Scientists' work

# LINEAR REGRESSION
linear regression - y = mx + b
m = slope of line
b = y intercept
x = input or independent variable
y = dependent variable

but how do we know if model is good?
  statistics rvalue, pvalue

go back to dataset, compare price

to reduce the error, add more variables
the smaller the error, the better the model
